# nasp-homework library
## A library that keeps on giving (headaches)\.\.\.
Just a bit of a personal project/homework I did for my Advanced Algorithms and
Data Structures course\. I highly doubt anyone will ever read this, but if you
do, be sure to leave a star so that I know you've been here ðŸ™‚\.

## Goals
* ðŸ˜ˆ Create the best code library the Faculty of Electrical Engineering Sarajevo
has ever and will ever see
* ðŸ¦€ Learn some basic Rust
* ðŸ˜Œ Annoy my tutors/teachers by requiring an installation of `rustup` to run
tests, thus spreading the crustacean plague

## Installation
1. Install `rustup` on your machine (please refer to [this](https://rustup.rs/))
2. Clone this repository

## Testing
1. Navigate to the local repository
2. Run `cargo test` or `cargo test --test module_name` in your shell of choice
3. Run `cargo run` for a fun little menu app (optional)

## Known issues
* Industrial society and its consequences

## Licence
Licenced under the GNU General Purpose Licence 3.0 because libre software is
based and redpilled\.
